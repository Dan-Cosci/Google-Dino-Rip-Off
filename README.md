# DINO RUNNER RIP OFF

## FOREWORD
So this is yet another game that I made but this time I used the pygame module of python to make this thing work. Being inspired by the Google Dino offline game I wanted to create a version of it on my own. So this is just gonna a random mini-project once again before I try to make something more idiotic than this brain-dead game.

## REQUIREMENTS
The requirements to run this code is just python and and install the pygame module using the pip command
```
python pip install pygame
```

```
python  = 3.12.7
pygame  = 2.6.1 
```
