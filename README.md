## Reflection
This project was started on October 30, 2024, as a fun exercise during a break from college work. It was challenging due to limited references (relying solely on `pygame` documentation without AI assistance). Completing it was a rewarding experience and a great learning opportunity, especially in managing project scaling and debugging. 

Looking forward to more projects ahead!
